# ðŸ§± Blocraft CLI

blocraft is a CLI tool to quickly scaffold Flutter projects using Bloc and Clean Architecture. It generates a modular folder structure and injects essential dependencies automatically, including a choice between equatable or freezed for state management.

---

## ðŸ”§ Installation

To install blocraft globally, run:

```bash
dart pub global activate blocraft
```

Make sure your Dart pub cache global executables path is added to your system PATH:

```bash
$env:PATH += ";$HOME\.pub-cache\bin"   # PowerShell (Windows)
# or
export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin" # Bash (Linux/macOS)
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Initialize Project Structure & Dependencies

```bash
blocraft init
```
- Creates the core, shared, and features base folders under `lib/src/`.
- Prompts you to choose between `equatable` or `freezed` for state management helper.
- Automatically injects dependencies (`bloc`, `flutter_bloc`, `go_router`, `dartz`, and your chosen state helper) into your `pubspec.yaml`.

### Generate a Feature Structure

```bash
blocraft feature <feature_name>
```
- Generates the folder structure for a specific feature (e.g., `auth`).

## ðŸ“¦ Dependency Management

When you run `blocraft init`, the following dependencies will be automatically added to your `pubspec.yaml`:

### Main dependencies
1. **bloc** â€“ State management using the Bloc pattern.
2. **flutter_bloc** â€“ Bloc integration for Flutter apps.
3. **go_router** â€“ Modern routing and navigation for Flutter.
4. **dartz** â€“ Functional programming utilities (e.g., Either, Option, etc).

### State management helper (user choice)
- If you choose **equatable**:
  5. **equatable** â€“ Simplifies value equality for Dart objects (default).
- If you choose **freezed**:
  5. **freezed_annotation** â€“ Annotations for freezed models (added to dependencies).
  6. **freezed** â€“ Main code generation package (added to dev_dependencies).
  7. **build_runner** â€“ Code generation runner (added to dev_dependencies).

All other essential dependencies are injected automatically if not present.

## ðŸ“‚ Generated Folder Structure

### After running `blocraft init`:

```
lib/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ core/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ error/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes/
    â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ usecases/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers/
    â””â”€â”€ features/
```

### After running `blocraft feature <feature_name>` (e.g., `blocraft feature auth`):

```
lib/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ features/
        â””â”€â”€ auth/
            â”œâ”€â”€ data/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/
            â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ usecases/
            â””â”€â”€ presentation/
                â”œâ”€â”€ bloc/
                â””â”€â”€ pages/
```
